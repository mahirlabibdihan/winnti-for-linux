The Linux version of Winnti is comprised of two files: a main backdoor (libxselinux) and a library (libxselinux.so) used to hide itâ€™s activity on an infected system.

Winnti Linux is an updated variant of the Winnti backdoor, created by the advanced persistent threat group of the same name.

Winnti Linux's primary module, called libxselinux, is a lightly modified version of the open-source Azazel rootlet. Once installed, it will decrypt an embedded port configuration file before connecting to a command and control server using a variety of protocols (HTTP, ICMP, and custom TCP/UDP) and modifying commonly used functions to disguise its operations.
